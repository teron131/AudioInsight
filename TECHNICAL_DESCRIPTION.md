## Non-Blocking Event-Based Processing Architecture

### **Fire-and-Forget Worker Management**

The non-blocking system ensures transcription flow is never interrupted by LLM processing:

```python
class EventBasedProcessor:
    def __init__(self, queue_maxsize=75, max_concurrent_workers=2):
        self.processing_queue = asyncio.Queue(maxsize=queue_maxsize)
        self.worker_tasks = [
            asyncio.create_task(self._worker()) 
            for _ in range(max_concurrent_workers)
        ]
        self.shared_executor = get_shared_executor()
    
    def queue_for_processing(self, item):
        """Queue item for background processing - returns immediately"""
        try:
            self.processing_queue.put_nowait(item)  # Non-blocking put
            return True
        except asyncio.QueueFull:
            return False  # Queue full, but don't block transcription
    
    async def _worker(self):
        """Individual worker processing items from shared queue in background"""
        while self.is_running:
            item = await self.processing_queue.get()
            if item is None:  # Shutdown signal
                break
            
            # Process using shared thread pool executor (background)
            await self._process_item(item)
            self.processing_queue.task_done()
```

### **Shared Thread Pool Optimization**

Critical performance improvement eliminating executor creation overhead:

```python
# Global shared executor - created once, reused everywhere
_shared_executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=4, thread_name_prefix="llm-executor")

async def invoke_llm(prompt, variables):
    """Optimized LLM invocation using shared executor"""
    executor = get_shared_executor()  # Reuse existing executor
    result = await asyncio.get_event_loop().run_in_executor(
        executor, lambda: chain.invoke(variables)
    )
    return result
```

**Performance Impact:**
- **Before**: New `ThreadPoolExecutor` created for every LLM call
- **After**: Single shared executor reused across all operations
- **Result**: ~90% reduction in execution overhead

### **Non-Blocking Queue Management**

Optimized queue sizes and cooldowns for different processing types with zero transcription lag:

| Component | Queue Size | Workers | Cooldown | Purpose | Blocking Behavior |
|-----------|------------|---------|----------|---------|-------------------|
| Parser | 75 items | 2 workers | 0.05s | Fast text correction | Never blocks |
| Summarizer | 150 items | 2 workers | 0.3s | Conversation analysis | Never blocks |
| UI Updates | N/A | 1 worker | 0.05s | Real-time display | 20 FPS smooth updates |
| Previous | 10-20 items | 1 worker | 1.0-5.0s | Legacy bottleneck | Caused 13s delays |

## Theoretical Foundation: The Streaming Challenge

### The Fundamental Problem

Traditional ASR models process complete audio sequences, presenting challenges for real-time streaming:

1. **Sequence Dependency**: Models expect complete context for accurate transcriptions
2. **Output Stability**: Partial inputs produce fluctuating and inconsistent outputs  
3. **Context Management**: Maintaining conversational context across streaming chunks
4. **Latency vs. Accuracy Trade-off**: Balancing immediate response with transcription quality
5. **LLM Processing Bottlenecks**: Sequential processing causing lag in analysis pipeline
6. **Real-Time Display Lag**: Blocking operations preventing smooth UI updates

### LocalAgreement Policy: Core Innovation

The **LocalAgreement-2** streaming policy solves output stability through hypothesis validation. When consecutive processing iterations agree on the same tokens, those tokens are committed as stable output.

#### **Mathematical Foundation**

Given streaming policy P processing audio chunks c₁, c₂, ..., cₙ:

For each time step t, the system maintains:
- H^(t-1): Previous hypothesis from chunks c₁...cₜ₋₁  
- H^(t): Current hypothesis from chunks c₁...cₜ
- C^(t): Committed tokens up to time t

The policy commits the longest common prefix:
```
C^(t) = C^(t-1) ∪ LongestCommonPrefix(H^(t-1), H^(t))
```

#### **LocalAgreement-2 Algorithm Implementation**

Core algorithm in `HypothesisBuffer.flush()`:

```python
def flush(self) -> List[ASRToken]:
    """Returns committed tokens based on longest common prefix between hypotheses."""
    committed: List[ASRToken] = []
    commit_count = 0
    min_length = min(len(self.new), len(self.buffer))
    
    # Find longest matching prefix
    while commit_count < min_length:
        if self.new[commit_count].text == self.buffer[commit_count].text:
            committed.append(self.new[commit_count])
            commit_count += 1
        else:
            break

    # Efficiently update buffers
    if commit_count > 0:
        self.new = self.new[commit_count:]
        self.buffer = self.buffer[commit_count:] if len(self.buffer) >= commit_count else []

    self.buffer = self.new
    self.new = []
    return committed
```

**Performance Optimizations**:
- Batch processing to avoid repeated operations
- Efficient list slicing instead of O(n) pop operations
- Memory-efficient buffer management

## Advanced Non-Blocking Performance Optimizations

### **Fire-and-Forget Concurrent Processing**

Worker coordination that never blocks transcription flow:

```python
async def _update_coordinator_llm_non_blocking(self, coordinator, text, speaker_info):
    """Update LLM without blocking transcription - fire and forget"""
    try:
        if coordinator and hasattr(coordinator, "llm"):
            # Queue for background processing - returns immediately
            coordinator.llm.update_transcription(text, speaker_info)
    except Exception as e:
        # Log errors but don't let them affect transcription
        logger.warning(f"LLM update failed (non-critical): {e}")

def update_transcription(self, new_text: str, speaker_info: Optional[Dict] = None):
    """Update with new transcription text - COMPLETELY NON-BLOCKING."""
    if not new_text.strip():
        return

    # Add to accumulated text immediately
    if self.accumulated_data:
        self.accumulated_data += " " + new_text
    else:
        self.accumulated_data = new_text

    # Schedule trigger checking for next event loop iteration (deferred)
    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
    loop.call_soon(self._check_inference_triggers)  # Non-blocking scheduling
```

### **Deferred Execution and Exception Isolation**

Intelligent processing that isolates LLM failures from transcription:

```python
def _check_inference_triggers(self):
    """Check if conditions are met for inference and queue request if needed - NON-BLOCKING."""
    if not self.accumulated_data.strip():
        return

    # Use base class method for basic checks (non-blocking)
    if not self.should_process(self.accumulated_data, self.trigger_config.min_text_length):
        return

    # Queue for background processing without blocking
    try:
        self.queue_for_processing(self.accumulated_data)
    except Exception as e:
        # LLM errors never affect transcription
        logger.warning(f"LLM trigger failed (non-critical): {e}")
```

### **Ultra-Responsive UI Updates**

Real-time display optimization for smooth user experience:

```python
# CRITICAL FIX: More aggressive yielding for real-time UI updates
should_yield = False

# Always yield if content has actually changed
if response_content != self.last_response_content:
    should_yield = True

# Also yield periodically even if content hasn't changed (for progress updates)
current_time = time()
if current_time - self.last_yield_time > 1.0:  # Force yield every 1 second
    should_yield = True

if should_yield:
    self.last_response_content = response_content
    self.last_yield_time = current_time
    yield final_response

await asyncio.sleep(0.05)  # 20 updates/second for smooth real-time responsiveness
```

### **Memory Management and Resource Pooling**

**Pre-allocated Shared Resources**: Thread pool executor shared across all LLM operations

**Efficient Queue Operations**: Large queues prevent blocking with intelligent backpressure

**Worker Pool Management**: Dynamic worker lifecycle with graceful shutdown

**Exception Resilience**: LLM failures isolated from core transcription pipeline

## Hypothesis Buffer Management System

### Token Lifecycle States

The buffer operates with three validation phases:

1. **New Tokens**: Fresh output from latest Whisper inference
2. **Buffer Tokens**: Previous hypothesis awaiting validation  
3. **Committed Tokens**: Validated tokens achieving cross-hypothesis agreement

### Streaming Engine Components

**Audio Buffer Management**: 
- `insert_audio_chunk()`: Accumulates incoming audio
- `process_iter()`: Triggers Whisper inference cycles

**Context Injection**: 
- `prompt()`: Extracts last 200 characters for conversational context

**Buffer Trimming**: 
- `chunk_completed_sentence()`: Intelligent memory management preserving semantic coherence

## Memory Management and Performance

### Buffer Optimization Strategies

**Pre-allocated Buffers**: Audio buffers dimensioned for expected processing patterns

**Zero-Copy Operations**: Optimized data flow minimizing memory allocation

**Circular Buffer Management**: Efficient slicing operations for rolling windows

**Dynamic Sizing**: Exponential growth strategy minimizing reallocation overhead

### Processing Pipeline Efficiency

**Parallel Processing**: Transcription, diarization, and LLM analysis operate concurrently without blocking

**Non-Blocking Event Coordination**: Fire-and-forget inter-processor communication with queue-based triggers

**Resource Pooling**: Shared thread pool and timing coordination

**Intelligent Batching**: Optimal batch sizes for different processing types

**Exception Isolation**: Component failures don't propagate to transcription flow

## Voice Activity Detection Integration

**Silero VAD Integration**: High-resolution speech detection (40ms chunks)

**Adaptive Processing**: State-driven processing triggering Whisper only during speech

**Utterance Boundary Detection**: Silence-based natural speech boundary identification

## Speaker Diarization System

### Real-Time Speaker Identification

**`DiartDiarization`**: Speaker identification using Diart pipeline with PyAnnote models

**`DiarizationObserver`**: Observer pattern for collecting speaker segments with memory management

**Retrospective Attribution**: Speaker labels assigned to committed tokens based on temporal overlap

**Consistent Speaker Mapping**: First detected speaker gets ID 0 for stable identification

## Error Recovery and Fault Tolerance

**Process Health Monitoring**: Continuous task health monitoring with automatic recovery

**Graceful Degradation**: Core transcription continues even when auxiliary components fail

**State Recovery**: Critical system state maintained for recovery from failures

**Coordinated Recovery**: Central coordinator manages cross-processor recovery procedures

**Worker Resilience**: Individual worker failures don't impact overall processing

**Exception Isolation**: LLM processing errors never affect real-time transcription flow
