# AudioInsight Streaming: Technical Description

## Overview

AudioInsight implements a sophisticated real-time streaming speech recognition system that transforms OpenAI's Whisper from a batch-processing model into a low-latency streaming ASR system. The core innovation lies in the LocalAgreement-2 algorithm, event-based concurrent processing architecture, and modular processing pipeline that enable stable real-time transcription with intelligent LLM-powered analysis.

## Event-Based Processing Architecture

### **Concurrent Worker Management**

The event-based system replaces traditional polling with efficient queue-based processing:

```python
class EventBasedProcessor:
    def __init__(self, queue_maxsize=50, max_concurrent_workers=3):
        self.processing_queue = asyncio.Queue(maxsize=queue_maxsize)
        self.worker_tasks = [
            asyncio.create_task(self._worker()) 
            for _ in range(max_concurrent_workers)
        ]
        self.shared_executor = get_shared_executor()
    
    async def _worker(self):
        """Individual worker processing items from shared queue"""
        while self.is_running:
            item = await self.processing_queue.get()
            if item is None:  # Shutdown signal
                break
            
            # Process using shared thread pool executor
            await self._process_item(item)
            self.processing_queue.task_done()
```

### **Shared Thread Pool Optimization**

Critical performance improvement eliminating executor creation overhead:

```python
# Global shared executor - created once, reused everywhere
_shared_executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=4, thread_name_prefix="llm-executor")

async def invoke_llm(prompt, variables):
    """Optimized LLM invocation using shared executor"""
    executor = get_shared_executor()  # Reuse existing executor
    result = await asyncio.get_event_loop().run_in_executor(
        executor, lambda: chain.invoke(variables)
    )
    return result
```

**Performance Impact:**
- **Before**: New `ThreadPoolExecutor` created for every LLM call
- **After**: Single shared executor reused across all operations
- **Result**: ~90% reduction in execution overhead

### **Intelligent Queue Management**

Optimized queue sizes and cooldowns for different processing types:

| Component | Queue Size | Workers | Cooldown | Purpose |
|-----------|------------|---------|----------|---------|
| Parser | 50 items | 3 workers | 0.1s | Fast text correction |
| Summarizer | 100 items | 2 workers | 0.5s | Conversation analysis |
| Previous | 10-20 items | 1 worker | 1.0-5.0s | Legacy bottleneck |

## Theoretical Foundation: The Streaming Challenge

### The Fundamental Problem

Traditional ASR models process complete audio sequences, presenting challenges for real-time streaming:

1. **Sequence Dependency**: Models expect complete context for accurate transcriptions
2. **Output Stability**: Partial inputs produce fluctuating and inconsistent outputs  
3. **Context Management**: Maintaining conversational context across streaming chunks
4. **Latency vs. Accuracy Trade-off**: Balancing immediate response with transcription quality
5. **LLM Processing Bottlenecks**: Sequential processing causing lag in analysis pipeline

### LocalAgreement Policy: Core Innovation

The **LocalAgreement-2** streaming policy solves output stability through hypothesis validation. When consecutive processing iterations agree on the same tokens, those tokens are committed as stable output.

#### **Mathematical Foundation**

Given streaming policy P processing audio chunks c₁, c₂, ..., cₙ:

For each time step t, the system maintains:
- H^(t-1): Previous hypothesis from chunks c₁...cₜ₋₁  
- H^(t): Current hypothesis from chunks c₁...cₜ
- C^(t): Committed tokens up to time t

The policy commits the longest common prefix:
```
C^(t) = C^(t-1) ∪ LongestCommonPrefix(H^(t-1), H^(t))
```

#### **LocalAgreement-2 Algorithm Implementation**

Core algorithm in `HypothesisBuffer.flush()`:

```python
def flush(self) -> List[ASRToken]:
    """Returns committed tokens based on longest common prefix between hypotheses."""
    committed: List[ASRToken] = []
    commit_count = 0
    min_length = min(len(self.new), len(self.buffer))
    
    # Find longest matching prefix
    while commit_count < min_length:
        if self.new[commit_count].text == self.buffer[commit_count].text:
            committed.append(self.new[commit_count])
            commit_count += 1
        else:
            break

    # Efficiently update buffers
    if commit_count > 0:
        self.new = self.new[commit_count:]
        self.buffer = self.buffer[commit_count:] if len(self.buffer) >= commit_count else []

    self.buffer = self.new
    self.new = []
    return committed
```

**Performance Optimizations**:
- Batch processing to avoid repeated operations
- Efficient list slicing instead of O(n) pop operations
- Memory-efficient buffer management

## Advanced Performance Optimizations

### **Thread-Safe Concurrent Processing**

Worker coordination with proper synchronization:

```python
async def _worker(self):
    """Thread-safe worker with proper state management"""
    worker_id = id(asyncio.current_task())
    
    while self.is_running:
        item = await self.processing_queue.get()
        if item is None:
            break
            
        # Atomic worker tracking
        self.active_workers += 1
        try:
            await self._process_item(item)
        finally:
            self.active_workers -= 1
            self.processing_queue.task_done()
```

### **Intelligent Batching and Cooldown Management**

Adaptive processing based on content and load:

```python
def should_process(self, data: str, min_size: int = 100) -> bool:
    """Intelligent processing triggers"""
    current_time = time.time()
    
    # Allow concurrent processing (removed blocking is_processing check)
    if (current_time - self.last_processing_time) < self.cooldown_seconds:
        return False
    
    # Prevent queue overflow
    if self.processing_queue.full():
        return False
        
    return len(data) >= min_size
```

### **Memory Management and Resource Pooling**

**Pre-allocated Shared Resources**: Thread pool executor shared across all LLM operations

**Efficient Queue Operations**: Large queues prevent blocking with intelligent backpressure

**Worker Pool Management**: Dynamic worker lifecycle with graceful shutdown

## Hypothesis Buffer Management System

### Token Lifecycle States

The buffer operates with three validation phases:

1. **New Tokens**: Fresh output from latest Whisper inference
2. **Buffer Tokens**: Previous hypothesis awaiting validation  
3. **Committed Tokens**: Validated tokens achieving cross-hypothesis agreement

### Streaming Engine Components

**Audio Buffer Management**: 
- `insert_audio_chunk()`: Accumulates incoming audio
- `process_iter()`: Triggers Whisper inference cycles

**Context Injection**: 
- `prompt()`: Extracts last 200 characters for conversational context

**Buffer Trimming**: 
- `chunk_completed_sentence()`: Intelligent memory management preserving semantic coherence

## Memory Management and Performance

### Buffer Optimization Strategies

**Pre-allocated Buffers**: Audio buffers dimensioned for expected processing patterns

**Zero-Copy Operations**: Optimized data flow minimizing memory allocation

**Circular Buffer Management**: Efficient slicing operations for rolling windows

**Dynamic Sizing**: Exponential growth strategy minimizing reallocation overhead

### Processing Pipeline Efficiency

**Parallel Processing**: Transcription, diarization, and LLM analysis operate concurrently

**Event-Based Coordination**: Efficient inter-processor communication with queue-based triggers

**Resource Pooling**: Shared thread pool and timing coordination

**Intelligent Batching**: Optimal batch sizes for different processing types

## Voice Activity Detection Integration

**Silero VAD Integration**: High-resolution speech detection (40ms chunks)

**Adaptive Processing**: State-driven processing triggering Whisper only during speech

**Utterance Boundary Detection**: Silence-based natural speech boundary identification

## Speaker Diarization System

### Real-Time Speaker Identification

**`DiarizationObserver`**: Observer pattern for collecting speaker segments with memory management

**Retrospective Attribution**: Speaker labels assigned to committed tokens based on temporal overlap

**Consistent Speaker Mapping**: First detected speaker gets ID 0 for stable identification

## Error Recovery and Fault Tolerance

**Process Health Monitoring**: Continuous task health monitoring with automatic recovery

**Graceful Degradation**: Core transcription continues even when auxiliary components fail
