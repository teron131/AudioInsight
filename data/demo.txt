# General Knowledge Base for Text Analysis

## Purpose
This document serves as a flexible knowledge base that can provide context or supplementary information for the text analysis system. You can populate this file with any relevant data that might help the AI assistant understand specific domains, terminologies, or background information related to the texts it processes (e.g., YouTube video transcripts, articles, meeting notes).

## How to Use
- **Provide Broad Context:** Include general information about a subject area that the analyzed texts might frequently cover. For example, if you often analyze videos about a specific technology, you could include key terms, concepts, and brief explanations here.
- **Define Custom Terminology:** If the texts use specific jargon, acronyms, or proprietary terms, define them in this document.
- **Supply Background Information:** For recurring topics, events, or entities, provide a concise background to aid in deeper analysis.
- **Examples:** You might include summaries of common themes, lists of important figures or organizations, or brief overviews of relevant theories or frameworks.

## Example Content Structure

### Section: [Relevant Topic Area 1]
- **Key Concept A:** Definition or brief explanation.
- **Key Concept B:** Definition or brief explanation.
- **Important Note:** Any specific nuance or detail the AI should be aware of.

### Section: [Relevant Topic Area 2]
- **Terminology 1:** Meaning and context.
- **Terminology 2:** Meaning and context.

## Guidelines
- Keep the information concise and to the point.
- Structure the content logically with clear headings.
- Update this document as needed to reflect new areas of focus or changing information.
- The AI assistant will be instructed to use this knowledge base to enrich its analysis, ask more insightful questions, and suggest more relevant follow-up actions.
